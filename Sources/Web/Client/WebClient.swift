/// A web client also provides `Request`s authorization, server trust evaluation,

/// - Note: A web client is *NOT* intended to work with a background URL session.

   ///              processed.
   /// - Returns: An object received from a server.
   /// - Throws: An error that occurred during request. It may be API error in case of 4xx or 5xx,
   ///           `URLError`, response converter error, or any other error.
